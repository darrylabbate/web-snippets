## About

This is a (growing) collection of CSS snippets mainly for my own personal reference.

All CSS is written in Sass and compiled to CSS/SCSS using the [Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) executable (installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)).

HTML is written in Slim format and compiled to HTML with the [Slim gem](https://github.com/slim-template/slim).

Screenshots are taken in Safari. All CSS is typically tested in Chrome.
